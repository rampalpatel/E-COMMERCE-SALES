# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **E-Commerce sales data** to uncover useful business insights.  
Using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn**, we explored the dataset, cleaned it, and performed analysis to answer key business questions like:1  1 You need to calculate the monthly sales of the store and identify which month had the 
 1 highest sales and which month had the lowest sales.
2. You need to analyze sales based on product categories and determine which category has
